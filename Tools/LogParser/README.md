# LogParser

A package for parsing the log output of the Ably Asset Tracking Swift SDKs and their example apps.

There is an example command-line app in [`Examples/CommandLineExample`](Examples/CommandLineExample) which demonstrates how to use the library. You can run it on an example log file by running the following command from the current directory:

```bash
swift run CommandLineExample Examples/CommandLineExample/example.txt
```
