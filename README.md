# Ably Asset Tracking SDKs for Swift

![.github/workflows/check.yml](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-swift/workflows/.github/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)

### Overview

Ably Asset Tracking SDKs provide an easy way to track multiple assets with realtime location updates powered by the [Ably](https://ably.com/) realtime network and Mapbox [Navigation SDK](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/overview/) with location enhancement.

### Status

This SDK is a beta version. That means it contains a subset of the final SDK functionality, and the APIs are subject to change. The latest release of the SDKs is available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-swift/releases) of this repository.

**Ably Asset Tracking is:**

- _easy to integrate_ - comprising two complementary SDKs with easy to use APIs, available for multiple platforms:
- Asset Publishing SDK, for embedding in apps running on the courier's device.
- Asset Subscribing SDK, for embedding in apps running on the customer's observing device.
- _extensible_ - as [Ably](https://ably.com/) is used as the underlying transport, you have direct access to your data and can use [Ably](https://ably.com/) integrations for a wide range of applications in addition to direct realtime subscriptions - examples include:
- passing to a 3rd party system
- persistence for later retrieval
- _built for purpose_ - the APIs and underlying functionality are explicitly designed to meet the requirements of a range of common asset tracking use-cases

This repo holds an Xcode workspace (`Examples/AblyAssetTracking.workspace`), containing:

Multiple example apps/ Xcode projects, and

One Swift Package (`ably-asset-tracking-swift`), containing three libraries/ SDKs:

- Publisher SDK: The `AblyAssetTrackingPublisher` library allows you to use `import AblyAssetTrackingPublisher`.

- Subscriber SDK: The `AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber` library allows you to use `import AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber`.

- Ably Asset Tracking UI SDK: The `AblyAssetTrackingUI` library allows you to use `import AblyAssetTrackingUI`.

  The UI SDK contains:
    - Location Animator - uses to animate map view annotation smoothly

- Publisher SDK: iOS 12.0+ / iPadOS 12.0+

- Subscriber SDK: iOS 12.0+ / iPadOS 12.0+

- Xcode 12.4+

- Swift 5.3+

### Swift package manager

- To install this package in an **Xcode Project**:
- Paste `https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-swift` in the "Swift Packages" search box. (Xcode project > Swift Packages.. > `+` button)
- Select the relevant SDK for your target. (Publisher SDK, Subscriber SDK or both)
- [This apple guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) explains the steps in more detail.
- To install this package into a **Swift Package**, add the following to your manifest (`Package.swift`):

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-swift", from: LATEST_VERSION),
```

_You can find the version on the [releases](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-swift/releases) page._

## Example Apps

- Configure your Mapbox credentials (`~/.netrc`) to download the Mapbox SDK by following [this](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/search/guides/install/#configure-credentials) guide. You'll need a Mapbox account.
- An `Examples/Secrets.xcconfig` file containing credentials (keys/ tokens) is required to build the example apps. (You can use the example `Examples/Example.Secrets.xcconfig`, e.g. by running `cp Examples/Example.Secrets.xcconfig Examples/Secrets.xcconfig`). Update the following values in `Examples/Secrets.xcconfig`:
- `ABLY_API_KEY`: Used by all example apps to authenticate with Ably using basic authentication. Not recommended in production, and can be taken from [here](https://ably.com/accounts).
- `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Used to access Mapbox Navigation SDK/ APIs, and can be taken from [here](https://account.mapbox.com/). Using the Mapbox token is only required to run the **Publisher** example apps.
- Open `AblyAssetTracking.xcworkspace` to open an Xcode workspace containing example apps and the Swift Package containing the SDKs that showcase how to use the Ably Asset Tracking SDKs.

## Usage

### Publisher SDK

The Asset Publisher SDK can efficiently acquire the location data on a device and publish location updates to other subscribers in realtime. Here is an example of how the Asset Publisher SDK can be used:

```swift
import AblyAssetTrackingPublisher

// Initialise a Publisher

publisher = try? PublisherFactory.publishers() // get a Publisher Builder
    .connection(ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY, clientId: CLIENT_ID)) // provide Ably configuration with credentials
    .log(LogConfiguration()) // provide logging configuration
    .transportationMode(TransportationMode()) // provide mode of transportation for better location enhancements
    .delegate(self) // provide delegate to handle location updates locally if needed
    .start()
    
// Start tracking an asset

publisher?.track(trackable: Trackable(id: trackingId)) // provide a tracking ID of the asset
```

### Subscriber SDK

The Asset Subscriber SDK can be used to receive location updates from a publisher in realtime. Here is an example of how Asset Subscribing SDK can be used:

```swift
import AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber

// Initialise a Subscriber

subscriber = try? SubscriberFactory.subscribers() // get a Subscriber Builder
    .connection(ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY, clientId: CLIENT_ID)) // provide Ably configuration with credentials
    .trackingId(trackingId) // provide a Tracking ID for the asset to be tracked
    .routingProfile(.cycling) // provide a routing profile for better location enhancements
    .log(LogConfiguration()) // provide logging configuration
    .delegate(self) // provide a delegate to handle received location updates
    .start() // start listening to updates
```

### Authentication

Both Subscriber and Publisher SDK support basic authentication (API key) and token authentication. Specify this by passing a `ConnectionConfiguration` to the Subscriber or Publisher builder: `SubscriberFactory.subscribers().connection(connectionConfiguration)`.

**To use basic authentication, set the following `ConnectionConfiguration` on the Subscriber or Publisher builder:**

```swift

let connectionConfiguration = ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY, clientId: clientId)

```
**To use token authentication, you can pass a closure which will be called when the Ably client needs to authenticate or reauthenticate:**

```swift
let connectionConfiguration = ConnectionConfiguration(clientId: clientId) { tokenParams, resultHandler in

    // Implement a request to your servers which provides either a TokenRequest (simplest), TokenDetails, JWT or token string.

    getTokenRequestJSONFromYourServer(tokenParams: tokenParams) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let tokenRequest):
            resultHandler(.success(.tokenRequest(tokenRequest)))
        case .failure(let error):
            resultHandler(.failure(error))
        }
    }
}
```

**Alternatively, in token authentication, you can specify an _authUrl_, which will be used by Ably to authenticate.**

```swift
let connectionConfiguration = ConnectionConfiguration(authUrl: authUrl, clientId: clientId)
```

### Ably Asset Tracking UI (Location Animator)

The `Location Animator` can interpolate and animate map annotation view.

```swift
// Instantiate Location Animator
let locationAnimator = DefaultLocationAnimator()
```

```swift
// Subscribe for `Location Animator` position updates
locationAnimator.subscribeForFrequentlyUpdatingPosition { position in
    // Update map view annotation position here
}
```

```swift
// Additionally you can subscribe for infrequently position updates
locationAnimator.subscribeForInfrequentlyUpdatingPosition { position in
    // Update map camera position
}
```

```swift
// Feed animator with location changes from the `Subscriber SDK`
func subscriber(sender: Subscriber, didUpdateEnhancedLocation locationUpdate: LocationUpdate) {
    locationAnimator.animateLocationUpdate(location: locationUpdate, interval: locationUpdateInterval / 1000.0)
}
```
