# Ably Asset Tracking SDKs for Cocoa

![.github/workflows/check.yml](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa/workflows/.github/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

Ably Asset Tracking SDKs provide an easy way to track multiple assets with realtime location updates powered by [Ably](https://ably.com/) realtime network and Mapbox [Navigation SDK](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/navigation/overview/) with location enhancement.

**Status:** this is a beta version of the SDKs. That means that it contains a subset of the final SDK functionality, and the APIs are subject to change. The latest release of the SDKs is available in the [Releases section](https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa/releases) of this repository.

Ably Asset Tracking is:

- **easy to integrate** - comprising two complementary SDKs with easy to use APIs, available for multiple platforms:
    - Asset Publishing SDK, for embedding in apps running on the courier's device
    - Asset Subscribing SDK, for embedding in apps runnong on the customer's observing device
- **extensible** - as Ably is used as the underlying transport, you have direct access to your data and can use Ably integrations for a wide range of applications in addition to direct realtime subscriptions - examples include:
    - passing to a 3rd party system
    - persistence for later retrieval
- **built for purpose** - the APIs and underlying functionality are designed specifically to meet the requirements of a range of common asset tracking use-cases

`ably-asset-tracking-swift` is a Swift package, containing 2 libraries/ SDKs, `AblyAssetTrackingPublisher` and `AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber`. These libraries each provide a set of importable targets a user can use as dependencies. 
 - Publisher SDK: The `AblyAssetTrackingPublisher` library allows you to use `import AblyAssetTrackingCore` and `import AblyAssetTrackingPublisher`.
 - Subscriber SDK: The `AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber` library allows you to use `import AblyAssetTrackingCore` and `import AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber`.

  .package(url: "https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-swift", from: "VERSION"),
  ```

### Cocoapods

- The SDK has not been released to Cocoapods.org trunk, but you can still use it by adding the relevant lines below to your Podfile:

  ```
  target 'Your App Name' do
    pod 'AblyAssetTracking/Publisher', :git => 'https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa' // To use the Publisher SDK
    pod 'AblyAssetTracking/Subscriber', :git => 'https://github.com/ably/ably-asset-tracking-cocoa' // To use the Subscriber SDK
  end
  ```

- Run `pod install` to update your Xcode project with these new Podfile dependencies

## Usage

The Asset Publishing SDK is used to get the location of the assets that need to be tracked.

Here is an example of how the Asset Publishing SDK can be used:

```swift
// Initialise a Publisher
publisher = try? PublisherFactory.publishers() // get a Publisher Builder
  .connection(ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY,
                                      clientId: CLIENT_ID)) // provide Ably configuration with credentials
  .log(LogConfiguration()) // provide logging configuration
  .transportationMode(TransportationMode()) // provide mode of transportation for better location enhancements
  .delegate(self) // provide delegate to handle location updates locally if needed
  .start()

// Start tracking an asset
publisher?.track(trackable: Trackable(id: trackingId)) // provide a tracking ID of the asset
```

Asset Subscribing SDK is used to receive the location of the required assets.

Here is an example of how Asset Subscribing SDK can be used:

```swift
subscriber = try? SubscriberFactory.subscribers() // get a Subscriber Builder
  .connection(ConnectionConfiguration(apiKey: ABLY_API_KEY,
                                      clientId: CLIENT_ID)) // provide Ably configuration with credentials
  .trackingId(trackingId) // provide a Tracking ID for the asset to be tracked
  .routingProfile(.cycling) // provide a routing profile for better location enhancements
  .log(LogConfiguration()) // provide logging configuration
  .delegate(self) // provide a delegate to handle received location updates
  .start() // start listening to updates
```

## Example Apps

Open `AblyAssetTracking.xcworkspace` to open a Xcode workspace containing example apps that showcase how Ably Asset Tracking SDKs can be used:

- the [Asset Publishing example app](PublisherExample/)
- the [Asset Subscribing example app](SubscriberExample/)

To build the apps you will need to specify credentials properties. Create a file called `Secrets.xconfig` in the root project directory (You can copy `Example.Secrets.xcconfig`, e.g. using `cp Example.Secrets.xcconfig Secrets.xcconfig`) and update the following values in the file:

- `ABLY_API_KEY`: Used by publishing and subscribing example apps to authenticate with Ably using basic authentication. Not recommended in production.
- `MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Used to access Mapbox Navigation SDK/ APIs.

## Development

### Package structure

These libraries expose modules, which can be imported into a users source code file. We have 4 targets, `AblyAssetTrackingCore`, `AblyAssetTrackingInternal`, `AblyAssetTrackingPublisher` and `AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber`. Internal is the only target not exposed to users, and is ideal for interfacing with Ably-cocoa in order to hide ably-cocoa interfaces from end users. All public entities in other targets, such as `AblyAssetTrackingCore`, are importable by users, by using `import AblyAssetTrackingCore`. All public entities in `AblyAssetTrackingInternal` are public to other targets in the same package, but not to users. 

The user will have to import both targets in their code to use entities in both Core and Publisher (or Subscriber). In the future, we may expose both `AblyAssetTrackingCore` and `AblyAssetTrackingPublisher` through one target using `@_exported`, so users only need to import one module. Similarly, a new target that joins `AblyAssetTrackingCore` and `AblyAssetTrackingSubscriber` will be created. 

### Getting started

The SDKs are bundled together in a Swift Package, which doesn't use a Xcode project (`xcodeproj`) or Xcode workspace (`xcworkspace`). Example apps are contained in 1 `xcworkspace`, each one being an `xcodeproj`.

- To develop the SDK, open the Swift Package in Xcode (You can either run `xed ably-asset-tracking-swift`, double click `Package.swift`, or open the directory in Xcode). To open the Swift Package using Jetbrains AppCode, you cannot use `appcode .` because it will automatically read the `.xcworkspace` file. Instead, you must go into AppCode and open the `Swift.package`.
- To develop the example apps, open the Xcode workspace file (`xed AblyAssetTracking.xcworkspace` or double click the workspace file). 

### Build instructions

This package uses Fastlane and Bundler (to make sure that the same version of development tools is used) and is developed using Xcode 12.2. However, building it's not straightforward and requires some extra steps.

1. Setup `.netrc` file as described in MapBox SDK documentation [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/search/guides/install/#configure-credentials). You can skip public token configuration for now. This is needed to obtain the Mapbox SDK dependency.
2. Install bundler using:

```
gem install bundler
```

3. Navigate to the project directory (one with .xcodeproj file) and execute:

```
bundle install
bundle exec pod install
```

#### Why Bundler

It's common that several developers (or CI) will have different tool versions installed locally on their machines, and it may cause compatibility problems (some tools might work only on dedicated versions). So to avoid asking everyone to upgrade/downgrade their local tools it's easier to use some tool to execute needed commands with preset versions and that's what Bundler does. Of course, you are still free to execute all CLI commands directly if you wish.

### Running tests locally

- Running in Xcode: Xcode automatically generates 1 Scheme (`ably-asset-tracking-swift-Package`) which will run all test targets specified in `Package.swift`. You can run those tests by selecting that scheme and pressing âŒ˜U or `Product` > `Test`.
  - Xcode can automatically generate test coverage.
- Running using Fastlane: 
  - To run all tests, run `bundle exec fastlane test_all`
  - To run only one target, run `bundle exec fastlane test_target_name`, where test_target_name can be `test_core`, `test_internal` or other test lanes are defined in `./Fastfile`.
  - The fastlane test lanes also use Slather to generate test coverage report, Open the html files to view them, e.g. `coverage_core/index.html`.  

### Coding Conventions and Style Guide

- The SDKs are written in Swift, however they still have to be compatible for use from Objective-C based apps.
- Favor Protocol Oriented Programming with Dependency Injection when writing any code. We're unable to create automatic mocks in Swift, so it'll be helpful for writing unit tests.
- SwiftLint is integrated into the project. Make sure that your code does not add any SwiftLint related warning.
- Please remove default Xcode header comments (with author, license and creation date) as they're not necessary.
- If you're adding or modifying any part of the public interface of SDK, please also update [QuickHelp](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Xcode/Reference/xcode_markup_formatting_ref/SymbolDocumentation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016497-CH51-SW1) documentation.

### Concepts and assumptions

- At the beginning, we aim only to support iOS, but we need to keep in mind macOS and tvOS
- Docs are written for both Swift and ObjC

### Release Procedure

#### Bumping the Version

To increment the version information for each release from the `main` branch:

1. Search for all instances of the `CFBundleShortVersionString` key in `Info.plist` files and increment according to release requirements, conforming to the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/) version 2.0.0.
2. Search for all instances of the `CFBundleVersion` key in `Info.plist` files and increment the integer value by 1, ignoring those indirected via `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)` (see next step).
3. Search for all instances of the `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION` key in `project.pbxproj` filesand increment the integer value by 1.

The version, both in SemVer string form and as an integer, **MUST** be the same across all projects in this repository (e.g. example app project versions must match those of the library they're built on top of).
